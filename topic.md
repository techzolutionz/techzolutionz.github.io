# Wifi Networking
---
A WiFi Network is a wireless network that connects to your Internet router and wireless-enabled devices (such as laptops, smartphones and printers) in your home, work space, or general area using a wireless radio signal. Your laptop/tablet/etc. uses a wireless adapter to translate data into a radio signal and transmit that signal using an antenna. Those radio waves emanate outwards from the antenna and are received by your wireless router. That wireless router then converts the radio waves back into data and then sends that data to the Internet using a physical connection.
